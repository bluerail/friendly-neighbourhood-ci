Your friendly neighbourhood continues integration annoyer
=========================================================
Simple Ruby continues integration script. It's fairly *simple* &
straightforward, and should *just work*â„¢.

Basic usage:

- `git clone myrepo myrepo.repo`
- `git clone another another.repo`
- `./ci.rb`
- *sit still and be amazed*


TODO: Properly document this ... :-/


**Warning** We run `git pull --force` on every repo. You probably do not want to
use this in repo's you're actually working in.
